# GPSTourGuide

Solved problem for the user

This is the proposal for an updated version of the TourGuide app. The TourGuide app is an application that, based on your GPS location, gives you notifications about sights nearby. The idea is that when you walk by a certain sight, let’s say The Eiffel Tower, the app gives you a notification. The notification includes a title, a short description and possibly a picture.

The idea is that users can add information about sights themselves within the app. So when you think you have something interesting to tell about a certain sight, you can add information to a database for other people to read. When other users later walk by the location where you added your information they get a notification.

The update for this app is that information added by users can be rated by other users. This because we want the database to be filled with useful and interesting information. So when you get a notification because you walked by a certain sight and you decide to read the information, you have the possibility to give the information a thumbs up or a thumbs down. When a piece of information has more then ten thumbs down, that piece will be removed from the database.
