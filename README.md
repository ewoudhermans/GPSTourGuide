# GPSTourGuide

Solved problem for the user

This application is going to be a new kind of tour guide. Using GPS, based on your location the app gives you interesting facts about your surroundings. When you are in a interested mood you can turn on the app. When you are radius of 20 meters of a certain sight (like the Anne Frank house), you get a notification from the app. When you open the notification it gives you a short factual description of the sight.

One of the things that makes this app different from other tour guide apps is that people can write their own information about sights. It’s not going to give you a link to Wikipedia for example. So the more active users there are, the more sights will be described.

Also should the information be short and factual. It should give you a short an interesting description and not a long boring text that takes to much time to read.

Similar application

-	City walks – This application presents you several self-guided walks in over 470 cities around the world. This is more a guide than an app that gives you short descriptions about sight. And you can not add your own information. This app is usable offline. 
-	Tourpal – Gives you locations of surrounding sight, restaurants, bars, hotels based on your GPS location. But does not give you information.
